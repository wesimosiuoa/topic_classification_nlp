# Text Classification using Naive Bayes and TF-IDF

This project demonstrates text classification using a Naive Bayes classifier along with TF-IDF vectorization. The goal is to categorize text documents into predefined topics such as Finance, Sports, Technology, and Politics. The script uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing, including tokenization and stopword removal.
